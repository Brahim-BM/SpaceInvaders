Here you'll find my own version of Space Invaders done for a project in class. After the last deadline, I decided to improve my way 
of coding my learning POO in Python ! In my first Space Invaders, I use global variables and in this one I learn to use class.

In order to run the game, you need tkinter library and Spyder ! 

Commands for Space Invaders :

Left, Right for moving
Space for Launching Missiles.

You can change the keys in the option menu as well as the language and the difficulty ! 

Good game !
